//! This is the R05a List fallback, not the full Launcher. It renders only what
//! Home already knows before unlock: no retained-open state, wallet inventory,
//! PIN presence or balances are inferred. Opening, renaming and deleting go
//! through the existing chain-bound catalog messages, so `Home::update`'s
//! normalization and the GUI unlock lifecycle stay the only route.
//!
//! Selection and search are transient presentation state owned by this Home.
//! They are never persisted and never change the authoritative lists, quotas
//! or recoverability.
