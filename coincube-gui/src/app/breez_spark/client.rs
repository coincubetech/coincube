//! Gui-side client for the `coincube-spark-bridge` subprocess.
//!
//! Architecture
//! ------------
//!
//! The Breez Spark SDK lives in a sibling binary because its dep graph
//! (rusqlite / libsqlite3-sys / tokio_with_wasm) can't be unified with
//! breez-sdk-liquid's. See `coincube-spark-bridge/Cargo.toml` for the
//! companion crate.
//!
//! [`SparkClient`] owns a [`tokio::process::Child`] and three background
//! tokio tasks:
//!
//! - **writer**: pulls [`Request`] frames from an mpsc channel and
//!   writes them as JSON lines to the child's stdin.
//! - **reader**: reads JSON lines from the child's stdout, parses
//!   [`Frame`]s, and routes [`Response`]s through a shared pending map
//!   (`id -> oneshot::Sender`). [`Event`] frames go to a future event
//!   channel (not wired in Phase 3 — just logged for now).
//! - **stderr pump**: relays each stderr line from the bridge into tracing
//!   at the severity the bridge itself emitted (see `relay_bridge_log`),
//!   stripping ANSI and demoting the SDK's empty-event keepalive.
//!
//! A request goes like: allocate id, insert `oneshot::Sender` into pending
//! map, send `Request` over the writer channel, await the oneshot. The
//! reader task resolves oneshots by id as responses come back, so
//! concurrent requests don't block each other.
//!
//! Lifecycle
//! ---------
//!
//! [`SparkClient::connect`] spawns the bridge, performs the
//! [`Method::Init`] handshake, and returns the client on success. If the
//! bridge exits before responding, or returns an error, the call fails
//! and the child is cleaned up. On drop the client sends a best-effort
//! [`Method::Shutdown`] (non-blocking fire-and-forget) and kills the
//! child if it didn't exit on its own — `kill_on_drop(true)` on the
//! `Command` ensures the OS reaps it even if the graceful path fails.
