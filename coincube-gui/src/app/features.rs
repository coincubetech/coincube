//! Network-aware feature availability — the single source of truth for
//! which wallet/marketplace features work on which Bitcoin network.
//!
//! On each network the launcher supports (mainnet, testnet, testnet4,
//! signet, regtest) only some features have a real backend. Rather than
//! hiding unsupported features, the nav renders them disabled / greyed
//! out with a hover popover whose text comes from [`Availability::reason`].
//!
//! Everything that needs to know "is feature X usable on network Y" asks
//! this module — the nav rails, the Liquid SDK loader, etc. — so the
