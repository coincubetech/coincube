//! "Receive from another network" — deposit any supported asset, receive
//! **Bitcoin** in the Spark wallet.
//!
//! Deliberately a close copy of [`crate::app::state::liquid::sideshift_receive`]:
//! same phases, same affiliate → shift → poll sequence, same 10s poll cadence.
//! Three things differ, and each of them is the reason this isn't just a
//! parameter on the Liquid flow:
//!
//! 1. **The settle leg is on-chain Bitcoin.** SideShift has no Lightning rail,
//!    so shifts settle to the Spark wallet's *static* on-chain deposit address
//!    (`receive_onchain(new_address = false)`). That address is reusable, which
//!    is what makes it safe for a variable-amount shift. It also means funds
//!    arrive after ~1 confirmation, not instantly — the status copy says so.
//! 2. **A refund address is collected up front**, on the *origin* chain. A
//!    shift that fails or gets held has to have somewhere to send the money
//!    back to, and asking afterwards is useless.
//! 3. **The user receives BTC, not the asset they deposited.** The copy never
//!    says "receive USDT" — you deposit USDT and bitcoin arrives, at the shift
//!    rate.
