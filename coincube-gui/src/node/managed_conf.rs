//! Serialised, atomic updates to the managed nodes' `bitcoin.conf` files.
//!
//! Two things can go wrong when the managed `bitcoin.conf` is edited without
//! coordination, and both are about *other writers of the same bytes*:
//!
//! 1. **Port allocation.** A new network section's RPC/P2P ports are chosen by
//!    reading every port already recorded — this file's other sections and the
//!    other chain family's file — and steering around them. Two allocations
//!    running at the same moment can both pass that check before either
//!    persists, and hand out the same port twice.
//! 2. **Read-modify-write.** Every writer of the file rebuilds it from a struct
//!    it read moments earlier. A writer that read before another one persisted
//!    a new section erases that section when it writes ("last writer wins").
//!    The inbound-Tor preparation and the legacy `consensusrules` migration do
//!    exactly this on every start.
//!
//! Both are closed by one datadir-wide, OS-backed exclusive lock
//! ([`ManagedConfLock`]) held across the whole read → decide → write span
//! ([`update_managed_conf`]), and by replacing the file atomically
//! ([`write_conf_atomically`]) so a reader never sees a torn file.
//!
//! What the lock is **not**: it does not reserve ports against processes that
//! do not take it — a third-party program, or an older COINCUBE binary still
//! running against the same datadir — and it does not make the conf and the
//! flavour ledger one crash-atomic transaction (they are two files; the ledger
//! is recorded first, as before). Bind-and-release port probing remains the
//! candidate source; see `docs/BTCB2_MANAGED_NODE.md`.
//!
//! Lock ordering: this is a leaf lock. It is never acquired while another lock
//! is held (the node-identity marker lock in `bitcoind::ensure_node_instance_marker`
//! is taken *after* it is released, never inside), and nothing blocking — no
//! Tor bootstrap, no node spawn, no RPC — runs while it is held.
