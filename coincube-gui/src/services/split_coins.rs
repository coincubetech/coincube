//! One-sided splits from Coin control (`decisions/2026-10-29-coincube-desktop-
//! btcb2-split-protection-in-coin-control.md`).
//!
//! A split is an ordinary self-send of the selected both-chain coins back to
//! a fresh change address in the same Vault, made so the twin chain rejects
//! it:
//!
//! - [`Method::SplitKey`] adds one coin proven to exist only on this chain
//!   (the split key). The twin chain has no such coin, so the transaction is
//!   invalid there. The key's proof is re-qualified against both canonical
//!   chains immediately before the transaction is built.
//! - [`Method::Signature`] (Bitcoin Blake2b only) relies on the Vault's
//!   replay-protected signature, which Bitcoin rejects. The signing screen's
//!   replay check still has to pass before broadcast. A txid commits to no
//!   witness, and the Vault could have signed the same transaction the
//!   legacy way too, so the twin Cube counts it only from the witness its
//!   confirming block commits to: [`twin_confirmed`] fetches that block,
//!   authenticates it ([`coincube_core::btcb2_block`]) and checks every
//!   signature is a valid `ALL|UNIFIED` one
//!   ([`coincube_core::confirmed_unified`]; decision open item 1). Its own
//!   outputs past the threshold still show *Split · unconfirmed*: the Vault
//!   could yet confirm a legacy copy on Bitcoin, so they are not proven
//!   one-chain coins.
//!
//! Either way one side is enough: once the split has depth, neither copy can
//! be replayed onto the other chain. The transaction is handed to the Vault's
//! normal PSBT screen for signing and broadcast, and recorded in a small
//! journal ([`journal`]) from which the Chains column derives *Splitting*
//! and candidate proofs for the split outputs, which a fresh ancestry check
//! must still verify. The twin Cube's journal only nominates its splits: a
//! coin counts as separated by one only once Connect shows that split
//! [`SPLIT_CONFIRMATIONS`] deep on the twin chain now and its confirmed
//! transaction spends the coin (and, for a signature split, carries only
//! unified signatures; [`twin_confirmed`]).
