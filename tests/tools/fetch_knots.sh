# Fetch a Bitcoin Knots release for this host, verify it against the
# PGP-signed SHA256SUMS with tests/tools/knots_verify (same trust anchor as the
# desktop installer), and print the path of the extracted `bitcoind`.

#   e.g. tests/tools/fetch_knots.sh 29.4.1.knots20260508
#
# Nothing is extracted unless verification succeeds. The cache dir defaults to
# tests/tools/knots/ (gitignored) and keeps the archive, the manifest and its
# signature next to the extraction.
#
# Reuse is never taken on trust. There is no "verified" marker: on every run
# the cached archive is verified again with the *current* knots_verify (so a
# change to the verifier or to the vendored signing key is applied to archives
# downloaded under the old one), and the extracted `bitcoind` is reused only if
# its SHA-256 equals the digest of the archive's own `bin/bitcoind` member,
# recomputed by streaming it out of the just-verified archive. A cached file
# that no longer verifies is discarded and fetched once more; if that copy does
# not verify either, the script fails and prints no path.
#
# KNOTS_TEST_BASE_URL (a file:// release directory) and KNOTS_TEST_VERIFY_PATH
# (a stand-in verifier) exist for tests/test_btcb2_tools.py and are honoured
# only together with KNOTS_TEST_MODE=1; any of them set otherwise makes the
# script exit before downloading or verifying anything, so an inherited
# variable can neither redirect the download nor replace the verifier. In test
# mode the stand-in verifier is mandatory: the real one is never searched for,
# so a test cannot silently run against a repo-local build. To use a
# knots_verify built elsewhere for real runs, set CARGO_TARGET_DIR to the same
# target dir it was built with; the trust anchor itself is never overridable.
